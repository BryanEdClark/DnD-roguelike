campaign characters arent showing feats, spells, inventory, equipment
update spells if the character automatically learns and prepares spells from a table at that level ex draconic sorcerer
group monsters by themes to create themed encounters
	Do  it based on location? (ex. Haunted Manor, Burning plains, foggy mountains)
Player monster manual - just images so as to not meta game
interactable battle map
multi class support
cast spells from character sheet?
reset just spell slots button
create custom monster
combat options ex. got hit for x damage and have it automatically deduct hp and do concentration checks
	can go further and be able to choose a spell/weapon and have it automatically roll for hit and damage, maybe create a turn plan ex. Monk attacks twice, bonus attacks twice, all at adavntage, then it rolls all the dice

roguelike arena
generate a random dungeon?
have it be full touch screen interactable

add it as an app?


bugs:
Wrong password just shows try again, enter keeps repompting it, just do an inline display of 'Wrong password'

prd changes:
tell it to update based on all the features we currently have and include
all saves should be to the server
all data changes should persist
all prompts should go through the gui
everything should be DnD 2024 rules
